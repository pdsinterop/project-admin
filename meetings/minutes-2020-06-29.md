### Meeting notes from last meeting
* https://github.com/pdsinterop/project-admin/blob/master/meetings/minutes-2020-06-22.md
* Action items progress checking: https://github.com/pdsinterop/project-admin/projects/1

### Weekly status update

#### Auke:

 * worked 9 hours, total now 25
 * have a nextcloud pdsinterop app
 * with an (empty) profile page

#### Michiel:
 * worked 8.5 hours, total now 30.5
 * Have 30 tests now in the webid-provider tests.
 * Contestants are still just node-solid-server and solid-app-kit (but this will change this week?)
 * Now looking at the login cookie, feels like I'm already over 30% of the total 1a milestone work

#### Yvo:
 * worked 2 hours, total now 18
 * Got a bit stuck on Blank nodes. Read up on them and did some experiments, but no working idea just yet.
 * For next week: following up on Michiel's suggestion to have them as named nodes instead, because that should also just work.
