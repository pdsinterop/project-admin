stand-alone met OAuth + OpenID going well
good thing about this library is that its code grant requires pkce, but their OIDC implementation is not complete,
so we'll need to contribute upstream there.
read a lot of specs. much deeper understanding of them now.
.well-known is now generated from the real config, not hard-coded.
wrote blogpost about how to use this OAuth library
getting ready to add DPop
