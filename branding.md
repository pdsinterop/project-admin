# Branding guidelines

This document outlines the rationale behind and expected use of branding related
to this project.

## Name

Everything is called something. This project is called: **PDS Interop**.

This stand for "**P**ersonal **D**ata **S**tore **Interop**erability"

### When coding

This project is technical by nature, because of this, our name will appear inside
code. When this happens, use "Pdsinterop", as _one word_.

A separator must not be used.

All letters except the "P" _must_ be lower-case. The "P" may be either lower-
or upper-case (depending on which is more appropriate in the context where it
appears).

For instance:

- ðŸŽ‰ Good
  - `pdsinterop`
  - `Pdsinterop`
- ðŸ’© Bad
  - `PdsInterop` (The `I` should be lowercase)
  - `PDSInterop` (All letters except the "P" _must_ be lowercase)
  - `pds-interop` (A separator must not be used)
  - `pds_interop` (A separator must not be used)

### When writing

When writing about this project, use "PDS Interop" as _two words_.

The "PDS" part _must_ be all capitals. There must not be any separators between the letters.

"Interop" _must_ be capitalized.

A separator other than the one space between both words must not be used.

For instance:

- ðŸŽ‰ Good
  - PDS Interop
- ðŸ’© Bad
  - Pds Interop (The "PDS" part _must_ be all capitals)
  - P.D.S. interop (There must not be any separators between the letters)
  - PDS interop ("Interop" must be capitalized)
  - PDS Inter-op (the dash separator is incorrect)
  - Pds-Interop (The separator should be a space, not a dash)
  - PDSInterop (Should be two words, space is missing)
  - PdsInterop (Should be two words, the casing is incorrect)

### Rational

The reasoning behind these choices is two-fold.

First of all, as "Personal Data Store Interoperability" is quite a mouthful,
using an abbreviation seemed more appropriate. For normal writing contexts, this is sufficient.

The second part: contexts where spaces are not available.

Besides in code, there are other places where a space can not be used in a name.
Either because of technical limitations (for instance in a domain name) or
because it is not supported (for instance on Twitter).

Between all of these contexts, it differs greatly what _can_ be used instead of
a space. Sometimes this is a dash `-` (for URLs), other times an underscore `_`
(in PHP code), or a dot `.` (in Javascript).

To avoid having our name written in a bunch of different ways, we opted for
consistency by simply removing the separator.
