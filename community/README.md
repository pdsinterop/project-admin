# Community

We're new, Solid is relatively new and fairly unknown, the whole semantic
web movement is largely ignored by most developers, let alone users.
So we'll have an uphill struggle to get developers and users to try solid
apps. 

So we must do an exceptional job in getting people to participate and try
out solid on nextcloud or in their own development projects.

We plan to do all our development in the open, so we should have open
communication channels, that people actually want to use. I think there are
a few types of channel we should support:

- direct - chat/talk
- asynchronous - forum/messages
- reference - wiki/knowledge base
- afk - talks/meetups/conferences
- existing communities

## chat

We currently have a slack channel, but that is not very open. We could open
it up, but I think if we want to do that, we might as well switch to
something like riot.im - based on matrix.org, or discord, since those are 
inherently more open. On the other hand, if the chat becomes too popular, 
we may want a more closed section for day to day stuff anyway.

## forum

There are github issues on the project-admin repo, but we've decided to use
these as current todo's for the people working on the project. So we
shouldn't let random people in there. We could use the issues in other
repo's, but that might interfere with actuall bugs/issues that early
adopters have.

Do we really need a forum anyway? I think we do. It helps offload the
direct/chat channel and our personal email addresses. A forum is also a
history of questions and answers and can, in a pinch, fill the role of a
knowledge base.

I personally favour something like vanillaforms.com, because I like the look
and feel. But we could also go for discourse.org. Both have a hosted
solution we might want to use to avoid getting bogged down in setting up and
hosting it ourselves.

## knowledge base

We're going to have to explain to people how and why to use our software. I
don't think we'll be able to write a detailed user manual, programmers
manual and reference. But if we can write small articles and combine them on
a single knowledge base site, we might accidentally write enough content to
fake them.

Github has a wiki feature, but we hate those. We could write everything in
markdown in git repo's on github, but I don't think that's easy enough to
manage or search. I would want a search system that allows for text search
as well as tags, date, author, etc.

I found http://docs.raneto.com/ which seems simple enough and might support
something like tags if we can add it to the meta block on each page. If we
want something a little more complete, I've made a prototype system that
supports search and tagging using SimplyEdit. I know I'm biased, so I'll let
Ben and Michiel decide if they want to try this.
